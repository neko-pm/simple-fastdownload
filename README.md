# simple-fastdownload

Provides fastdownload support for srcds without the need for webhosting. By default, it will automatically change the value of `sv_downloadurl` and serve files that are either in the downloadables stringtable or the mapcycle.

From here you can either leave it as is or begin to add bzip2 compressed versions of the files. These can either be in the same location as their non-compressed versions, or separately within the folder specified by `sv_downloadurl_bz2folder`.
